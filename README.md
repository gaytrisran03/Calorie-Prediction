## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict the number of calories burned during exercise sessions. It involves using machine learning techniques to create models that can accurately estimate the calorie expenditure based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises exercise and user data, including features like age, height, weight, gender, and the corresponding calories burned during exercise.

## Data Preprocessing

- Merged exercise and user data based on common identifiers.
- Processed and cleaned the dataset, handling missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical ones.

## Model Training

- Utilized multiple regression models such as Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

## Model Evaluation

- Assessed model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the evaluation metric.
